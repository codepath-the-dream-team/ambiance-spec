#Ambiance User Stories

Ambiance is an app that plays natural ambient sound to help you fall asleep, wake up, and enjoy the day.  Ambiance integrates with Amazon Echo to play sounds in your room.  When using Ambiance as your alarm clock, ambient sounds will slowly fade in to help you wake up naturally instead of jumping up when your alarm starts blaring.  Ambiance also provides sleep reports to quickly view your trends for when you went to bed and when you got up.

##Core User Stories

####As a user...
1. I would like to schedule my alarm so that it goes off when I need to wake up.
1. I would like an alarm that gradually fades in with ambient sound so that I can wake up naturally and avoid the shock of a beeping alarm.
1. I would like to set the maximum volume of the alarm so that it’s loud enough to wake me up, but isn’t so loud that it shocks me.
1. I would like to sample the real alarm so that I know just how loud my chosen volume will be.
1. I would like for the alarm to play on an external device like an Echo so that I can speak commands to the app and so that the sound plays through a better speaker.
1. I would like the application to promptly stop the sound when I ask it to, so that it does not interfere with other activities going on around me.
